Miss Dong You never forget your smile
Even if you're like me eager to aging
Miss Dong you are beautiful when  when your mouth is down
Like the clear water under the anhe bridge

Miss Dong I am also a complex animal
Mouth with a heart has been repeated over
Miss Dong Drum Tower at night time rush
Please give me a stranger a Maryland

So those who may not be true Miss Dong
You just is not a story of female students without
I can fall in love with a Mustang no prairie home
It makes me feel hopeless Miss Dong

Miss Dong extinguished cigarette you talking about the past
You said earlier life there is a tomorrow, so be it
Miss Dong Do you know enough to say goodbye to me
In May morning finally lost sleep

So those who may not be true Miss Dong
You just is not a story of female students without
I can fall in love with a Mustang no prairie home
It makes me feel hopeless Miss Dong

So those may all be true Miss Dong
Comfort those who patiently ignorant teenager
I want to like you, regardless of who it is
Come with me Miss Dong
Impatient Arise Miss Dong

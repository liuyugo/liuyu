Miss Dong You never forget your smile
Even if you're like me eager to aging
Miss Dong you are beautiful when  when your mouth is down
Like the clear water under the anhe bridge

Miss Dong I am also a complex animal
I can not say it but keep thingking in my heart
Miss Dong the  Tover night time is hurry
Please give me a a Maryland

So those who may not be true Miss Dong
You are not a female student without story 
I fall in love with a Mustang 
but I don not have prairie in my home 
It makes me feel hopeless Miss Dong

Miss Dong you extinguished cigarette talking about the past
You said let the earlier life  go , you have tomorrow
Miss Dong Do you know I said enough goodbye
In May morning finally I lost sleep

So those who may not be true Miss Dong
You are not female student without story
I fall in love with a Mustang
but I do not have prairie
It makes me feel hopeless Miss Dong

So those may all be true Miss Dong
Who want to comfort that ignorant teenager
I want to like you, regardless of who it is
Come with me Miss Dong
Impatient Arise Miss Dong
